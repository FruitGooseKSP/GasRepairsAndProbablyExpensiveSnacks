	description = Much like an avarice child sticking their finger in every cake at a party to claim it as there's, this fuel station sign does the same for Uranus Gas when added to a collection of fuel tanks in space. However, this means they will set up a fuel network for you to refuel at, which is useful unlike the child who will probably just vomit.
